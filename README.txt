Flatiron School Science Fair Booklet Parser


Important notes:

- If the output of the survey changes, the output should be re-downloaded and put in bak/sps.txt.
- If an attachment (a photo or a resume) is bad / doesn't exist, the relevant script(s) will break at the point it's downloaded.
- DO NOT RUN clean.sh FROM THE ROOT DIRECTORY. This needs to be fixed and safeguarded against. (Done!)

Time providing, these will be improved and automated. (i.e., it'd be nice to check the file validity before downloading, and skip it if it's invalid. This might require `curb`ing the data upon running a main script.)
