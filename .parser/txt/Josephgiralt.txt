bio: "Joseph Giralt is known among friends as the most interesting man in the world.  \r\n\r\nDuring his time in the US Army, he became airborne qualified and passed the Special Forces Assessment & Selection course.  \r\n\r\nHe loves kittens, but adores all animals.  \r\n\r\nJoe has earned a living as a stained glass mosaic artist, bartender, dj, boxing instructor, Muay Thai fighter, and most recently a director of operations for a hardware start-up - but most recently, he's been veritably glued to his computer screen."
