bio: 
- "Max grew up in suburban Westchester, New York and had a solid public school education which included just a little computer science. Mainly a typing class. That was great. He liked to type fast before he knew what to type. There was also an introductory C++ class which he did pretty well in. Then he and a friend made a Mario rip-off game in a pirated copy of Flash which didn't get \"blammed\" from Newgrounds, which he figured was his peak as a programmer, so he went to The University of Vermont and made a bunch of short films and wrote a bunch of short stories and maybe one poem."
- "After college, in the \"real world\", programming slowly crept back into his life. A few of his high school friends had stuck with it and were now working in the industry and it seemed very exciting to dust off the old keyboard and see if any of the old concepts had stuck to his ribs. Besides, during those years, software had become the most exciting popular expressive medium to him. The same way, when he first got an iPod with a hard drive he suddenly had a furnace to feed albums into and a way to care deeply about more artists (one of the best compliments he's every received: 'wow, you have the best iTunes library I've ever seen'), iOS and the new age of web applications opened the doors for him to care about independent developers and tools that seemed tailor-made for him and people like him. So whenever he wasn't working for his dad at the ribbon company, he was reading and experimenting and eventually attending meetups and doing a little tutoring and now he's at Flatiron School, where his learning has hyper accelerated."
