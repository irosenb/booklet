bio: "Nothing makes David happier than collaborating side-by-side with bright, creative people building very cool things while learning as much as he can in the process. \r\n\r\nOriginally from South Florida, David attended the University of Florida (after brief stints pursuing becoming an airline pilot and a marine biologist) where he earned a degree with honors in electrical engineering. After graduating, he moved to Dallas to work for Accenture, where he quickly moved up the ranks as a technology consultant. At Accenture he worked on wide variety of large scale IT design and integration projects for Fortune 500 companies. Following Accenture, David joined Bank of America’s Technology Operations group where he managed technology implementation projects at the two largest check-processing centers in the United States.  (Los Angeles and San Francisco, if you're wondering.)\r\n\r\nAfter Bank of America, David performed a career “pivot” moving back to Florida and becoming a high school mathematics teacher. He taught AP Calculus at a large, public high school in Miami and later moved to New York City where, until recently, he taught at a private high school in Brooklyn working with students with documented learning disabilities. Today, David, spends his time (a lot of it) at the Flatiron School working hard to sharply hone his software and web development skills and knowledge - all in preparation for soon joining an innovative, cutting-edge company in defining and building the future of the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhen not coding, debugging, experimenting, tinkering, reading, or trying to come up with the next big thing, David enjoys technical photography, watching food shows with his beautiful fiancé, and exploring the world around us."
