bio: "Chris Gonzales graduated from the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley in 2011 after finishing his Portuguese minor in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After completing his studies and teaching English to children in the favelas, he found his way to New York City at the Goldman Sachs Product Control group, where he spent two years managing a structured debt portfolio of $11B.\r\n\r\nThe San Diego native enjoys exploring the concrete jungle via bike and skateboard, sampling (indulging, really) in its libations and delicacies and writing catchy ditties on his acoustic guitar. Despite overwhelming demand for a revival of his previous musical effort, The Witch Doctors, Chris denies any plans of a reunion at this time."
