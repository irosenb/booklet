bio: "Educated in the United States and Switzerland, Alisa speaks fluent English, French and conversational Italian. She has undergraduate degrees in Art Studio and Art History, and an MBA in Entrepreneurship & Finance.

Alisa kicked off her professional life as a temp clerk at The New York Times Quality Assurance department.  This was supposed to be an interim position until a graphic designer position opened up, but it turns out that clerical work consists of a lot of downtime.  Wanting to know more about what she was doing and why, she became absorbed with learning all aspects of print reproduction and was soon invited to manage the QA department.  This trajectory gradually led Alisa to a Senior Management position of Process Improvement Director, in which capacity she led the continuous improvement strategy and helped solve complex technical problems.

Keenly aware of the decline of the newspaper industry, she knew she had to explore opportunities in and outside of The Times to a) keep her skills up-to-date, and b) home in on her strongest areas of interest.  While working full-time, she completed two Culinary School degrees, received an MBA, and co-launched a Baby subscription startup.  This journey has led Alisa to realize that she wants to be in the business of building cool stuff that solves real problems, and this is how she ended up at the Flatiron School. When she's not learning how to code, you'll likely find Alisa in her aquaponic greenhouse or cooking up a storm."
