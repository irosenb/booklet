During undergrad, Kirin studied and researched the American government, and closely followed the Arab Spring Revolutions - which involved translating masses of information such as tweets, articles, and plays from Arabic to English.

He studied Chemistry in college and worked for short time as a chemist. Less than a year ago Thomas decided he'd pick up coding because he wanted to build cool stuff. Now, Thomas feels, rightly or wrongly, that he's reached that sweet spot in skill level where no programming challenge is too advanced.

As a young child, Matt spent countless hours building with Legos, assembling backyard furniture sets sans instruction manuals, wiring his childhood home for internet and cable, and taking apart (and improving!) the family computers. Those pastimes led him to enroll in the Academy for Telecommunication and Computer Science, a Bergen County Academies high school. There, Matt's technical exposure began with Java, HTML/CSS, Oracle database design, and Cisco networking fundamentals. \r\n\r\nAfter graduating high school, Matt attended the Olin Business School at Washington University in St Louis, majoring in Economics and Entrepreneurship. Outside of class, he owned and operated Bears’ Bikes bicycle shop, served as president of his fraternity (Sigma Chi), and was the co-founder of the WashU Student Entrepreneurial Program’s Chamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\nDuring his senior year, Matt and his friend Brian developed a business plan for Flash It, LLC, a company focused on offering consumer tracking services to small businesses for customer management and individualized marketing. Brian was in charge of the technical side of the business; Matt was responsible for sales and operations. Unable to test and release a solid product, Flash It failed (fast). Realizing he wanted to be the one building, failing, and building again, Matt returned to his first love, technology, to arm himself with the skills to make it happen.	Yes	NYC-area

She has undergraduate degrees in Art Studio and Art History, and an MBA in Entrepreneurship & Finance.\r\n\r\nAlisa kicked off her professional life as a temp clerk at The New York Times Quality Assurance department.  This was supposed to be an interim position until a graphic designer position opened up, but it turns out that clerical work consists of a lot of downtime.  Wanting to know more about what she was doing and why, she became absorbed with learning all aspects of print reproduction and was soon invited to manage the QA department.  This trajectory gradually led Alisa to a Senior Management position of Process Improvement Director, in which capacity she led the continuous improvement strategy and helped solve complex technical problems.\r\n\r\nKeenly aware of the decline of the newspaper industry, she knew she had to explore opportunities in and outside of The Times to a) keep her skills up-to-date, and b) home in on her strongest areas of interest.  While working full-time, she completed two Culinary School degrees, received an MBA, and co-launched a Baby subscription startup.  This journey has led Alisa to realize that she wants to be in the business of building cool stuff that solves real problems, and this is how she ended up at the Flatiron School. When she's not learning how to code, you'll likely find Alisa in her aquaponic greenhouse or cooking up a storm.	Yes	NYC-area

Mainly a typing class. That was great. He liked to type fast before he knew what to type. There was also an introductory C++ class which he did pretty well in. Then he and a friend made a Mario rip-off game in a pirated copy of Flash which didn't get \"blammed\" from Newgrounds, which he figured was his peak as a programmer, so he went to The University of Vermont and made a bunch of short films and wrote a bunch of short stories and maybe one poem.\r\n\r\nAfter college, in the \"real world\", programming slowly crept back into his life. A few of his high school friends had stuck with it and were now working in the industry and it seemed very exciting to dust off the old keyboard and see if any of the old concepts had stuck to his ribs. Besides, during those years, software had become the most exciting popular expressive medium to him. The same way, when he first got an iPod with a hard drive he suddenly had a furnace to feed albums into and a way to care deeply about more artists (one of the best compliments he's every received: 'wow, you have the best iTunes library I've ever seen'), iOS and the new age of web applications opened the doors for him to care about independent developers and tools that seemed tailor-made for him and people like him. So whenever he wasn't working for his dad at the ribbon company, he was reading and experimenting and eventually attending meetups and doing a little tutoring and now he's at Flatiron School, where his learning has hyper accelerated.

Though always buoyed by a great passion for the arts, Sarah eventually reached a point where her mere proximity to creativity as a sales analyst was no longer enough. This, coupled with the sneaking suspicion that there was in fact a better way to complete the repetitive aspects of her work in ebooks and ecommerce caused her to dig deeper into the world of macros, automation, and later code.\r\n\r\nInitially it was exposure to the fields of user research and usability testing that sparked the idea of one day marrying her previous studies in psychology with her interest in digital culture. But after having personally witnessed the effects of disruptive technologies first upon music and then the publishing industry, Sarah began to see coding as more than just a passing interest and instead a downright necessity and future career path.\r\n\r\nUltimately Sarah hopes to work on products that harness the power of technology for good and make real life better. In her spare time she can be found preparing overly-complicated recipes and stalking the local greenmarkets for the arrival of the latest short-season produce. \r\n	Yes	NYC-area

No, honestly, Ning had no idea how fascinating coding could be, nor how far it might take him. Ning's path has always been to challenge himself and tackle the most interesting problems, solving them in unique ways. A Westchester native, his curiosity led him to complete a Music Industry major at the University of Southern California in LA. There he explored his passion in music, joining the Trojan Marching Band on saxophone, while also playing piano, violin, and writing and producing electro-pop for fun. Later, he would teach himself how to play cello by buying one off of Craiglist (he's resourceful). \r\n\r\nAlways interested in media and the creative industry, he would return to NYC and intern on the Broadway show Xanadu, work as a production assistant on shows such as VH1's \"Who Wants to Work for Diddy\", and even play piano for babies at Kidville/Little Maestros. Ning's technical skills are nothing to sneeze at. Realizing his knack for troubleshooting technology, he took on IT support roles at Halcrow, an engineering firm and then at large ad agencies Grey and JWT as a consultant working through Mike's Tech Shop (a boutique tech firm located in the Flatiron District). Armed with skills to be a full-stack web developer, Ning feels there is no limit to what he can achieve in the near and distant future. Also, Ning visited Egypt this past November, and it was awesome. He feels everyone should visit as soon as possible!\r\n	Yes	NYC-area

He eventually became critical of his own abilities to effect change and vowed to become a programmer, in part, by attending the Flatiron School. He hopes to build great things that help people through his budding code skills. \r\n\r\nIn his spare time, Alex can be found scribbling notes on the subway, reading the latest issue of \"One Piece,\" or grooving to a tune on Hype Machine.

He's never met an adventure he didn't like. If he could live forever he would and he would try everything twice. So far some things he's tried are Tae Kwon Do, mechanics, chess, moving from Seattle to Louisiana with a backpack and no plan, scaling castle walls in Belfast, and living with three girls.\r\n\r\nDesmond left school to pursue working with hands. He attended Georgetown to study really abstract things like math and philosophy. Then he left to take a year off and discovered that you don't need to understand those abstract things to participate in the real world. He worked for a year in the offshore oil-field as a mechanic until he started to miss his friends and family. His best friend convinced him to move to New York. In New York he found he could make a living woodworking and delivering diapers at night. He made french polished veneered furniture for penthouse apartments and live-edge solid wood furniture for family-members. Then at night he listened to rock biographies in fast-forward while navigating the 5 boroughs with a truck full of dirty cloth diapers. When he got tired of working two jobs he tried web development and fell in love with it.\r\n\r\nEvery morning he wakes up feeling like a champ ready for the best day of his life.	Yes	NYC-area
