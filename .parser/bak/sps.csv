Prior to The Flatiron School, Ruthie was a research analyst on the digital strategy team at Publicis Kaplan Thaler, an advertising agency in New York. She graduated from Princeton in June 2012 with a B.A. magna cum laude in Anthropology and Certificates in Environmental Studies and Film/Video Production. While at Princeton, she conducted original research for her senior thesis on climate change in the Maldives, filmed and produced documentaries on bellydancing in Alaska and jewelry in Israel, led peers on civic engagement trips across America, and organized events at the Princeton University Art Museum. In her summers, she helped develop a platform for user-generated climate content; and worked as a consulting intern for the International Water Management Institute in India, interviewing stakeholders and conducting user experience surveys for knowledge product development. She has always been interested in how people engage with information that challenges them, and in bridging between technical and non-technical thinkers. She is excited to leverage those experiences and interests as a developer.	Yes	NYC-area		2013-07-29 16:44:58	public	2013-08-01 07:12:51	flatiron school	184.75.101.229	4	1

After graduating, he moved to Dallas to work for Accenture, where he quickly moved up the ranks as a technology consultant. At Accenture he worked on wide variety of large scale IT design and integration projects for Fortune 500 companies. Following Accenture, David joined Bank of Americaâs Technology Operations group where he managed technology implementation projects at the two largest check-processing centers in the United States.  (Los Angeles and San Francisco, if you're wondering.)

After Bank of America, David performed a career âpivotâ moving back to Florida and becoming a high school mathematics teacher. He taught AP Calculus at a large, public high school in Miami and later moved to New York City where, until recently, he taught at a private high school in Brooklyn working with students with documented learning disabilities. Today, David, spends his time (a lot of it) at the Flatiron School working hard to sharply hone his software and web development skills and knowledge - all in preparation for soon joining an innovative, cutting-edge company in defining and building the future of the Internet.

When not coding, debugging, experimenting, tinkering, reading, or trying to come up with the next big thing, David enjoys technical photography, watching food shows with his beautiful fiancÃ©, and exploring the world around us."

Although New York always feels like home for Sagar, he does love to travel. While at NYU, Sagar got the opportunity to travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina and Mumbai, India as part of his curriculum.

As a young child, Matt spent countless hours building with Legos, assembling backyard furniture sets sans instruction manuals, wiring his childhood home for internet and cable, and taking apart (and improving!) the family computers. Those pastimes led him to enroll in the Academy for Telecommunication and Computer Science, a Bergen County Academies high school. There, Matt's technical exposure began with Java, HTML/CSS, Oracle database design, and Cisco networking fundamentals. 

After graduating high school, Matt attended the Olin Business School at Washington University in St Louis, majoring in Economics and Entrepreneurship. Outside of class, he owned and operated Bearsâ Bikes bicycle shop, served as president of his fraternity (Sigma Chi), and was the co-founder of the WashU Student Entrepreneurial Programâs Chamber of Commerce.

Brian was in charge of the technical side of the business; Matt was responsible for sales and operations. Unable to test and release a solid product, Flash It failed (fast).

She has undergraduate degrees in Art Studio and Art History, and an MBA in Entrepreneurship & Finance.

Alisa kicked off her professional life as a temp clerk at The New York Times Quality Assurance department.  This was supposed to be an interim position until a graphic designer position opened up, but it turns out that clerical work consists of a lot of downtime.  Wanting to know more about what she was doing and why, she became absorbed with learning all aspects of print reproduction and was soon invited to manage the QA department.  This trajectory gradually led Alisa to a Senior Management position of Process Improvement Director, in which capacity she led the continuous improvement strategy and helped solve complex technical problems.

Keenly aware of the decline of the newspaper industry, she knew she had to explore opportunities in and outside of The Times to a) keep her skills up-to-date, and b) home in on her strongest areas of interest.  While working full-time, she completed two Culinary School degrees, received an MBA, and co-launched a Baby subscription startup.  This journey has led Alisa to realize that she wants to be in the business of building cool stuff that solves real problems, and this is how she ended up at the Flatiron School.

He liked to type fast before he knew what to type. There was also an introductory C++ class which he did pretty well in. Then he and a friend made a Mario rip-off game in a pirated copy of Flash which didn't get ""blammed"" from Newgrounds, which he figured was his peak as a programmer, so he went to The University of Vermont and made a bunch of short films and wrote a bunch of short stories and maybe one poem.

After college, in the ""real world"", programming slowly crept back into his life. A few of his high school friends had stuck with it and were now working in the industry and it seemed very exciting to dust off the old keyboard and see if any of the old concepts had stuck to his ribs. Besides, during those years, software had become the most exciting popular expressive medium to him. The same way, when he first got an iPod with a hard drive he suddenly had a furnace to feed albums into and a way to care deeply about more artists (one of the best compliments he's every received: 'wow, you have the best iTunes library I've ever seen'), iOS and the new age of web applications opened the doors for him to care about independent developers and tools that seemed tailor-made for him and people like him.

"	"Sarah was brought to coding by both her prior work in media and a lifelong fascination with technology and its ever-increasing impact on our lives. Though always buoyed by a great passion for the arts, Sarah eventually reached a point where her mere proximity to creativity as a sales analyst was no longer enough. This, coupled with the sneaking suspicion that there was in fact a better way to complete the repetitive aspects of her work in ebooks and ecommerce caused her to dig deeper into the world of macros, automation, and later code.

Initially it was exposure to the fields of user research and usability testing that sparked the idea of one day marrying her previous studies in psychology with her interest in digital culture. But after having personally witnessed the effects of disruptive technologies first upon music and then the publishing industry, Sarah began to see coding as more than just a passing interest and instead a downright necessity and future career path.

Ultimately Sarah hopes to work on products that harness the power of technology for good and make real life better. In her spare time she can be found preparing overly-complicated recipes and stalking the local greenmarkets for the arrival of the latest short-season produce.

No, honestly, Ning had no idea how fascinating coding could be, nor how far it might take him. Ning's path has always been to challenge himself and tackle the most interesting problems, solving them in unique ways. A Westchester native, his curiosity led him to complete a Music Industry major at the University of Southern California in LA. There he explored his passion in music, joining the Trojan Marching Band on saxophone, while also playing piano, violin, and writing and producing electro-pop for fun. Later, he would teach himself how to play cello by buying one off of Craiglist (he's resourceful). 

Always interested in media and the creative industry, he would return to NYC and intern on the Broadway show Xanadu, work as a production assistant on shows such as VH1's ""Who Wants to Work for Diddy"", and even play piano for babies at Kidville/Little Maestros. Ning's technical skills are nothing to sneeze at. Realizing his knack for troubleshooting technology, he took on IT support roles at Halcrow, an engineering firm and then at large ad agencies Grey and JWT as a consultant working through Mike's Tech Shop (a boutique tech firm located in the Flatiron District). Armed with skills to be a full-stack web developer, Ning feels there is no limit to what he can achieve in the near and distant future. Also, Ning visited Egypt this past November, and it was awesome. He feels everyone should visit as soon as possible!

Having his interest stoked, he investigated different avenues for improving education, including helping to start an alternative school and working as an education policy analyst. He eventually became critical of his own abilities to effect change and vowed to become a programmer, in part, by attending the Flatiron School. He hopes to build great things that help people through his budding code skills. 

In his spare time, Alex can be found scribbling notes on the subway, reading the latest issue of ""One Piece,"" or grooving to a tune on Hype Machine. He's a huge fan of Seth Godin, Peter Drucker, and Jorge Luis Borges. After Flatiron School, he's an even bigger fan of programming.

Dan's been trying to fix problems, help people, and save the world since he was a little kid. He graduated from Williams College and Johns Hopkins SAIS (Nanjing), worked in national policy and politics, and has extensive international work and study experience. He was a firefighter and emt when younger, started an animal rescue non-profit in Taiwan, and loves you.Â  Not like that.Â  In a good way.

He taught himself enough Chinese in one year to do his graduate work on law and politics entirely in Mandarin, and returned to the US to support the first Obama campaign. Later he stuck his nose into dirty, dark corporate places on three continents as an investigator/analyst with an international consulting company run by the former director of the FBI, and solved puzzles filled with complex networks of people, behaviors, and laws.

He left the world of corporate dirty laundry to make a startup trying to create new marketplace by democratizing access to wifi connection points.Â Â After the company's meteoric rise from getting seed funded toâ¦Â  getting strong-armed into submission by one of the country's largest corporations, he began learning code.Â  All the lights clicked and haven't stopped since.

Dan's a fixer, a creative problem solver and builder by nature, and now happily and irreversibly obsessed with code and contributing to the coding community.

The San Diego native enjoys exploring the concrete jungle via bike and skateboard, sampling (indulging, really) in its libations and delicacies and writing catchy ditties on his acoustic guitar.

Immigrating from El Salvador at the age of two, his parents pushed him academically and encouraged him to pursue a career in science and technology. During his undergraduate career, Carlos interned for three summers at both Metlife and Lockheed Martin in application development and systems engineering. After graduating from college in 2008, Carlos was accepted into the Engineering Leadership Development Program at BAE Systems, Inc., where he spent 5 years adding value to the United States' missile and RADAR defense systems. Carlos holds two engineering degrees - a B.S. in Computer & Systems Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a M.S. Electrical & Computer Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

Carlos realized that technical growth opportunities within the defense market were limited. He took his career into his own hands, and is now learning the ropes of web development full-time at the Flatiron School in the great city of New York. Using his previous work experience, cultural / global mindset, and his passion for catalyzing change, he looks forward to using his newly attained web programming powers to solve different engineering problems that plague the planet today."
