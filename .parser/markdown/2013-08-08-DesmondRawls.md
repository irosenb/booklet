bio: "Desmond is not a house cat. He's never met an adventure he didn't like. If he could live forever he would and he would try everything twice. So far some things he's tried are Tae Kwon Do, mechanics, chess, moving from Seattle to Louisiana with a backpack and no plan, scaling castle walls in Belfast, and living with three girls.\r\n\r\nDesmond left school to pursue working with hands. He attended Georgetown to study really abstract things like math and philosophy. Then he left to take a year off and discovered that you don't need to understand those abstract things to participate in the real world. He worked for a year in the offshore oil-field as a mechanic until he started to miss his friends and family. His best friend convinced him to move to New York. In New York he found he could make a living woodworking and delivering diapers at night. He made french polished veneered furniture for penthouse apartments and live-edge solid wood furniture for family-members. Then at night he listened to rock biographies in fast-forward while navigating the 5 boroughs with a truck full of dirty cloth diapers. When he got tired of working two jobs he tried web development and fell in love with it.\r\n\r\nEvery morning he wakes up feeling like a champ ready for the best day of his life."
