bio: 
- "Jordán attended kindergarten in Indonesia, and studied Anthropology and other esoteric topics at Yale University. As a management consultant, he has advised clients in the US, Switzerland, Germany and Austria focusing on growth strategy in the healthcare and food industries."
- "Recently he has bootstrapped and produced several web products, such as a mobile application for photocontests on Instagram. He enjoys ruby immensely, and believes code that dispenses with excessive adornments (such as semi-colons!) can be elegant."
- "Jordán enjoys animated discussions involving concept and speculation. He is a slowly improving guitarist, an enthusiastic but frequently defeated tennis player, and a writer of obscure essays. He is fluent in English and Spanish and a passable German speaker. "
