bio: 
- "A native New Yorker, Ruthie is optimistic about the energy and creativity of the city's emerging tech scene, and looking forward to become a part of it.  Prior to The Flatiron School, Ruthie was a research analyst on the digital strategy team at Publicis Kaplan Thaler, an advertising agency in New York. She graduated from Princeton in June 2012 with a B.A. magna cum laude in Anthropology and Certificates in Environmental Studies and Film/Video Production. While at Princeton, she conducted original research for her senior thesis on climate change in the Maldives, filmed and produced documentaries on bellydancing in Alaska and jewelry in Israel, led peers on civic engagement trips across America, and organized events at the Princeton University Art Museum. In her summers, she helped develop a platform for user-generated climate content; and worked as a consulting intern for the International Water Management Institute in India, interviewing stakeholders and conducting user experience surveys for knowledge product development. She has always been interested in how people engage with information that challenges them, and in bridging between technical and non-technical thinkers. She is excited to leverage those experiences and interests as a developer."
