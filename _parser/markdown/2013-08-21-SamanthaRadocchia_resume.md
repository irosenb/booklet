bio: 
- "Everything can be found here: http://samantharadocchia.com/\r\n\r\nI started out my teen years as an Abercrombie-and-Puka-Shell-Wearing youth. In 2002 (that long ago already?!), I enrolled in The Loomis Chaffee School, a boarding school in Windsor, CT and was changed forever--into a Polo-Wearing prepster... Kidding. At Loomis I found my passion for film, music, and the digital arts, as well as an irrational love for risk taking. At sixteen, I was selected as one of twenty people in the country to take part in an exchange program with Oxford University, where I took college-level courses in Psychology and Social Behavior. At the time, the only use I could see for these classes was perhaps as a cure to my social awkwardness. These classes, however, would soon prove to be instrumental in my future understandings of markets and demographics. At seventeen, I obtained my pilot's license mainly because physics made absolutely no sense to me on paper. A year later I decided to take my little exercise in \"applied physics\" a step farther, getting an instrument rating for my private pilot certificate and learning the in's and out's of aeronautical engineering. After graduating from Loomis Chaffee I then went on to take a gap year in between high school and college, during which I moved to NYC to pursue a film career, worked as a ski instructor in Stowe, VT, and helped to establish an NGO in Rabat, Morocco, which sought to empower women through computer literacy training. It was during this year that I developed an affinity for skydiving, ultimately competing in four-way formation teams at the pro-level and accumulating over 700 jumps."
- "Sam learning to code at 5\r\nIn looking at the photo to your left, a few things are fairly obvious:\r\n\r\n(1) Computers were far more interesting to me than Hooked on Phonics.\r\n(2) I knew I wanted to go into business at a very young age.\r\n(3) Apparently I envisioned the adult version of myself as having a beard and abnormally short legs."
- "Fortunately, all three of these things have come to fruition as I have matured into adulthood! (Do you get what I mean about that awkward moment when someone totally misinterprets sarcasm yet?) Anyways, when I sit back and think about what I'm doing and how I got here I always come back to these photographs, because they don't lie. You may ask, \"Why exactly did I choose to become an entrepreneur?\" and my response to you would be this: What did I choose? I was born to do this.\r\n\r\nI started out my teen years as an Abercrombie-and-Puka-Shell-Wearing youth.

- "By the time I arrived to Colgate University as a college freshman, I had a lot under my belt. I was traveling every weekend to compete with my skydiving team; however, after a few short weeks found a niche in the small upstate community. My love for linguistics, critical theory, and symbolic systems helped me to bridge the gap between the limited/slightly impractical liberal arts majors and I was able to find relevance in courses ranging from English to Sociology/Anthropology to Computer Science. I focused my studies on symbolic systems specifically in respect to the digital/virtual space and online communities. Unlike most college graduates who were finding it very difficult to procure employment with their liberal arts degrees, I'd seemed to had found a niche. So I continued my studies: First, at King's College in London where I studied creative approaches to Management and Entrepreneurship and co-founded my first company--a music sampling and collaboration application that enabled independent music producers to collaborate with studio-associated producers on songs and albums; and next, at New York University, where I pursued Master's Degree in Digital Media and graduated Summa Cum Laude in the spring of 2013."
- "In addition to my rather droll status as a nerdy academic type, I am also a self-taught web developer (proficient in HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, Python, Django, Ruby on Rails) and am about to embark on a three month course at The Flatiron School to polish my skills. In the midst the dense jungle that is academia, I also co-founded the clothing aggregator and social commerce platform, Stunable, during my senior year at Colgate and am still currently working there. Our company is about to do big things so follow me there -- I pretty much devote all of my time to that gig. Finally, one last thing, if you have the time to check out Machine Elf, please do! This is my second company and it's about to release its first application called Virtual Gate, an augmented reality game/training tool for recreational and competitive skiers that places virtual racing gates on trails of the skier's choice. The app works in tandem with Recon Instruments' Heads Up Display Goggles and gathers trail map data from many major US Ski Resorts in order to create a virtual race environment that is both challenging and safe."
