routes: 
	get /login #=> 'sessions#new'

	post '/login' => 'sessions#create'

	get '/logout' #=> 'sessions#destroy'

	/register #=> users#new
	POST /users => users#create

form_for is specifically for wrapping a form around an active record object
<%= form_tag login_path do %>
	<p>
		<%= label_tag "Email" %>
		<%= test_field_tag "Email" %>
		<%= submit_tag "Log in" %>
	</p>
<% end %>

put current_user method in ApplicationController so that everything has access to it
