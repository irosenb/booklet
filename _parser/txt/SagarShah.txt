bio: 
- "Although Sagar spent the majority of his childhood in New Jersey, he still likes to believe that the first three months of his life in Queens qualify him as a true New Yorker. After a brief stint attending school in Boston, Sagar had enough of life outside of the tri-state area and transferred to New York University's Stern School of Business. Although New York always feels like home for Sagar, he does love to travel. While at NYU, Sagar got the opportunity to travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina and Mumbai, India as part of his curriculum. In Mumbai, Sagar participated in an exchange program and learned about economic development in the complicated and chaotic country that is India. In Buenos Aires he just partied for a week and it was awesome."
- "Sagar graduated NYU in 2010 with a degree in finance and economics. Afterwords, he worked in consulting helping clients make financial decisions using valuation techniques. Sagar could value almost anything for you. Ultimately, Sagar realized that he had a real interest in programming. He can't resist the joy of building fun programs and solving the interesting problems that come along with them."
- "When Sagar is not programming, you can find him playing basketball against people a foot taller than him, decompressing with a good sitcom, or listening to TED talks or This American Life."
