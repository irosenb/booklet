bio: "Kirin is passionate about solving problems, from solving Sudoku puzzles, to explaining the finer points of American pop culture to her curious foreign grandparents, to developing programs in Ruby.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Kirin attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where she earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in Public Policy and Political Science. During undergrad, Kirin studied and researched the American government, and closely followed the Arab Spring Revolutions - which involved translating masses of information such as tweets, articles, and plays from Arabic to English.  A political junkie, Kirin is lucky to have worked as an analyst in the BGOV sector at Bloomberg LP, for Message & Media, and for a representative to the US Congress in her home state."
